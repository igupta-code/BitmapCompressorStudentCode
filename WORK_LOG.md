We talked about organizing data in bytes with the first digit of the byte representing if the string of upcoming values is a 0 or 1 and the following units representing how many numbers are in that sequence. |

And then couldn't get it back :( |

He also pointed out that I shouldn't be reading in the file as a char, but instead as a boolean so I get get each 0 or 1 one at a time. |

| Nov 21 |  6-6:30   |                                          I tested my compression and expansion code a bit and it doesn't quite work. My compression does make the data smaller, but the expansion doesn't bring it back up to the full size. I'm not sure if the error is in the compression or expansion, but I'm guessing it has something to do with how I am reading/printing the data(like i'm not using the correct number of bits). |

I changed it so we assume that the bitmap starts with a 0 each following number represent the opposite digit. I have yet to test. |

I then tried running compress which sent me into an infinite loop(some debugging showed I was not really reading in data where I needed to be). Both run now, but my expanded version is way too big. |

| Dec 2  | 7:15-8pm  |                                                                                                                                                                              I restructured my compress function which took awhile and made it a lot nicer but I don't think it actually changed anything... My real issue was I wasn't printing out the last code in my expansion file. After fixing that my code worked. |
