| Nov 18 | 1-1:40pm | I started writing the compress function in class. We talked about organizing data in bytes with the first digit of the byte representing if the string of upcoming values is a 0 or 1 and the following units representing how many numbers are in that sequence. |
| Nov 18 | 5:30-6pm |                                                                                                                            So I somehow managed to delete the data on the bin files when trying to run my compression algorithm. And then couldn't get it back :( |
